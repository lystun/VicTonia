                                                It's been three years since he came to this side of the country. Ogbomoso holds a special place in his heart. It had given him experiences of God, ambition, and adventure. One thing it had failed to fill his coffer with was love. His heart has been broken the few times he had given it away. The last two times were extremely brutal. He was ready to turn his back on romance now—time to move on to other things. She bounced in through the rusty gate of the famous White House. Donning her signature pink headset, she waltz right in, tired from the day's work. He saw her and would have looked away, if not for the angel upon his shoulder, that urged him to glance a little longer. Then he saw it, Her shirt flowing in the wind like the flag of a queen leading a charge, her brown tank top like a warrior's armour. He wondered, "who is this beau passing by?" He greeted her. But she was too tired to notice him or hear him. She mumbled a greeting to the saints gathered in the living room before disappearing into the girls' room. She wasn't thinking about love. Her newly healed heart has left her mind to fill her brain with beautiful pictures of career and progress...

                                                As they say - one thing led to another. 100 WhatsApp messages became 10,000. There was always something to talk about. 
                                                At a point, they made a pact, he promised not to ask her out, and she promised not to fall in love with him (We both know whether or not that promise was kept). Though she started smiling from ear to ear more frequently than ever, and He was almost constantly purple from blushing. He was climbing cashew trees to make video calls. She was sitting under mango trees to receive them. Still, they would not admit the obvious.
                                                At first, they danced around the well, and she told him his application was denied . But blessed be the angels who carry out the word of the Lord. Conspiring in the hidden light according to the volume of the books written until the fullness of time when salvation appeared as grace and truth. Till that one night they confessed their love to one another, the walls around their hearts had been shattered. Hallelujah!

He was taking a new shape. *But she wouldn't let him off so quickly; he made him wait until the midnight of the fifth day at the rising of a new moon to give her answer. She was so beautiful inside and out that the moon must bear witness to her decision. She said, no! He was broken, but he formed "hard guy." Then like the sparkling of a lightning bolt - She said Yes!
                                                Their love grew stronger. He stole her friends and made them his henchmen to litter her ways with surprises and adventure. She converted his friends to her foot soldiers plotting and devising to make him a fit king. 
                                                Sometimes they throw tantrums; she can be a baby, and he an even bigger baby. Despite all, the pilgrimage continued, and at the crossroad of prayer, a quest was delivered. A quest of a lifetime to begin on the 12th day of the 12th month in the 20th year of the 20th hundred year in the year of the Lord.
